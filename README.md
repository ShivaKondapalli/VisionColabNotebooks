# Computer Vision Colab Notebooks

## Introduction

Jupyter notebooks of Computer Vision projects run from google Colab. Google colab notebooks allow us to leverage the pwoer of GPU's
for free.

## 1. FineTuningVFeatureExtraction.ipynb

Fine Tuning vs Feature Extraction are two types of transfer learning. In most real world application one uses either of these methods to
achieve good results on some data collected and labelled appropriately.

Compared the two methods on the *cifar 10 dataset*, augmented the data set with rotations, reflections, and various other linear 
transformations.

## 2. FlowerMapping.ipynb

This is the notebook version of *image_classification.py* hosted at [VisionPytorch](https://github.com/ShivaKondapalli/VisionPytorch).
Saved the model, loaded it back again to predict species of flowers with a picture of the flower in question.

## 3. FMNIST.ipynb

This is the notebook version of *FMNIST.py* hosted at [VisionPytorch](https://github.com/ShivaKondapalli/VisionPytorch). 
Used a custom coded cnn model. Gave expository walkthrough of CNN, the filters and kernels used in it and how it differs 
from a plain vanilla feedforward NN or multilayer pereceptron.

## 4. MNIST.ipynb

This is the notebook version of *MNIST.py* hosted at [VisionPytorch](https://github.com/ShivaKondapalli/VisionPytorch).

## Copy_of_lesson3Planet.ipynb

This is a google colab notebook of looking at Amazon satellite images from space with the fastai library
